WindSensorBoard Calibration and Verification
============================================

Calibration
-----------

Switch on the wind tunnel and put the robot with the nose pointing in downwind direction into the wind tunnel.

Set the integration interval to 8:
	./windsensorboard_ntc_integration 8
Lower values (e.g. 6) yield bad results, while bigger values (e.g. 10) take considerably more time. A full calibration with 8 takes about 30 minutes.

To test how many steps the robot needs to turn once on the spot, try:
	./windsensorboard_windsensor_calibration --turn -s 5700
with different values for "s".

Once the correct "s" value has been determined, launch:
	./windsensorboard_windsensor_calibration --calibrate -s 5700
To store the calibration in a file, run:
	./windsensorboard_windsensor_calibration --download > my_calibration_file
and to recover it from a file, run:
	./windsensorboard_windsensor_calibration --upload < my_calibration_file


Verification
------------

To verify the calibration, launch
	./windsensorboard_windsensor_calibration --verify -s 5700 > my_verification
with the same "s" value you determined before.

Parse the output file with
	./parse_verification.pl < my_verification > my_verification_matlab
and plot it in Matlab with
	load my_verification_matlab;
	plot_verification(my_verification_matlab);
