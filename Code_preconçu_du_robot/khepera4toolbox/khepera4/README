Khepera IV Toolbox
================================================================================

Welcome to the Khepera IV Toolbox!

This is but a ported version of the Khepera III Toolbox, developped over the 
years by multiple contributors.

This README file contains only a few pointers and quick start information. The
documentation of the K3 toolbox is available online as wikibook, and should
mostly apply to the current library:
	http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Khepera_III_Toolbox
This documentation also includes installation guidelines, a short introduction
for new users and a lot of examples.

For a very quick start, here is how you have to set your environment variables
in order to use the toolbox:
	export K4_ROOT=/path/to/the/khepera4toolbox
	export PATH=$PATH:$K4_ROOT/Scripts

Enjoy working with the Khepera IV robot!
